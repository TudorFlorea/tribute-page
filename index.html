            <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/; Serbo-Croatian: [nǐkola têsla]; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943)
                 was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his
                  contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

            <br />
            <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s
                 and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric
                 power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for
                  a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners
                  to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical
                  and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by
                  Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase
                  system which that company would eventually market.

                    Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
                     oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat,
                     one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities
                     and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued
                     his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power
                     experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication 
                     with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an
                     intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
